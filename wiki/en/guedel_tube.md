The **Guedel Tube**, or Oropharyngeal Airway (OPA) is an {% include hl.html t="Airway Adjunct" %} used to keep the upper airway open in unconscious patients.

# Function
The guedel tube is used to manage loss of airway reflexes and {% include hl.html t="Airway Collapse" %} by physically opening the airway and allowing air to pass through the tube into the airway.

When inserted it will block access to other oral-inserted airway adjuncts and prevent establishing of the {% include hl.html t="Recovery Position" %}.

The guedel tube has a limited ability to mitigate airway collapse and will need to be replaced with an advanced airway if the patient is unconscious for a prolonged time.

The guedel tube does not prevent {% include hl.html t="Airway Obstructions" l="Airway_Obstruction" %}, obstructions need to be cleared if they occur.

# Usage
{% include git-wiki/components/template/action_note.html name="Insert Guedel Tube" bodypart="Head" category="airway" %}

The Guedel Tube can be removed at any point, and will be automatically removed upon the patient waking up.
<br><br>
- **{% include hl.html t="Head Tilt-Chin Lift" %} -** If the patient has severe airway collapse a head tilt-chin lift can be performed with a guedel tube inserted to mitigate the collapse and keep the airway open.
- **Recovery Position -** If the patient is placed into the recovery position inserting a guedel tube will cancel the recovery position.
- **{% include hl.html t="CPR" %} and {% include hl.html t="BVM" i="/wiki/image/bvm.png" %} -** An inserted guedel tube does not allow simultaneous CPR and BVM use.

## Indications
- Unconscious patient with no inserted airway adjunct

## Contraindications
- An advanced airway is already in place
- Airway obstruction
- Severe airway collapse
