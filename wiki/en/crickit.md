The CricKit is a single use kit used to establish a {% include hl.html t="Surgical Airway" %} when all other airway management options fail. 

# Function

# Usage
{% include git-wiki/components/template/action_note.html name="Establish Surgical Airway" bodypart="Head" category="airway" %}

The kit is consumed upon completing, cancelling or failing to establish a surgical airway.
- If a surgical airway is cancelled before an incision is made then the crickit is returned instead

Once established the surgical airway will not be able to be removed, and the patient will stay unconscious.<br><br>
